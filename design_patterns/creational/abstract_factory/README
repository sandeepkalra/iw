Abstract Factory Pattern is - Factory of Factory!

Assume 2 factories:
	1. ShapeFactory -- draws Rectangle, Triangle, Circle
	2. ColorFactory -- fills color Green, Red, Blue
AbstractFactory->GetFactory("shape") will return 1st factory.
AbstractFactory->GetFactory("color") will return 2nd factory.
Each of these factories can then have their respective objects returned.
